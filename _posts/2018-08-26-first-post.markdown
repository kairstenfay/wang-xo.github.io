Welcome, visitor!

Here you will find work that I had done in java and python, including such treasures as:
 - fighting huskies
 - predicting the sugars
 - properly naming variables


{% highlight python %}
dogNames = ['George', 'Geoff', 'Geralt', 'Rumbalina']

catNames = ['Randy', 'Rusty', 'Rowdy', 'Guinevere']

animalFarm = [catNames, dogNames]

dogNames.extend(['Rupert'])
print(dogNames)
{% endhighlight %}
